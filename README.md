#TouchStone Demo #1

##Description 
TouchStone provides ecommerce retail merchants with an API-first integration and unified fraud management dashboard that leverages RAG models and LLM-based Agents, so they can increase their bottom line by preventing fraudulent refunds, free product replacements from being shipped to fraudsters, and exploitation of refund policies.

According to the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Apris Retail Report, refunds abuse and fraud amount to a $101 billion in lost value for retailers. Fashion retailers alone face $35B annual losses from "friendly fraud," particularly through false claims about undelivered packages.

TouchStone's API-first platform integrates directly into customer support software like Zendesk, Freshdesk, Gorgias, and Intercom. Our integration monitors customer support calls, online chats, and representatives’ case notes; and detects fraud patterns in real-time during customer interactions. Our AI agents first validate package did-not-arrive claims (the most common type of refund claim) by unifying fragmented data across courier services and providing instant package tracking data verification and photo proof of delivery to the customer support representatives. Our AI agents and RAG models. then analyze cross-merchant data streams to identify repeated fraud patterns in account creation/KYC footprints, past customer support conversations, and our unified package tracking data. We compare these fraud patterns against authentic claims to produce a fraudulent risk score (1-100%). This prevents false positives, protecting legitimate customer needs. 
During a customer support call, the support representative will receive a dynamic fraudulent risk score as the conversation progresses, which triggers automations and actionable notes as a response to the fraudulent activity being detected. Our AI agents will automate the refund approval and denial process based on the fraudulent risk score, reducing the standard weeks-long process to minutes – ultimately, making refund claim escalation obsolete. Along with our API-first platform, this solution scales through a unified dashboard where e-commerce merchants can visualize fraud patterns across all their customer support channels - phone, email, chat and social media.
